  abstract = {Phototropins (phot1 and phot2) are autophosphorylating serine/threonine kinases that function as photoreceptors for phototropism, light-induced chloroplast movement, and stomatal opening in Arabidopsis. The N-terminal region of phot1 and phot2 contains two specialized PAS domains, designated LOV1 and LOV2, which function as binding sites for the chromophore flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Both LOV1 and LOV2 undergo a self-contained photocycle, which involves the formation of a covalent adduct between the FMN chromophore and a conserved active-site cysteine residue (Cys39). Replacement of Cys39 with alanine abolishes the light-induced photochemical reaction of LOV1 and LOV2. Here we have used the Cys39Ala mutation to investigate the role of LOV1 and LOV2 in regulating phototropin function. Photochemical analysis of a bacterially expressed LOV1 \th{} LOV2 fusion protein indicates that LOV2 functions as the predominant light-sensing domain for phot1. LOV2 also plays a major role in mediating light-dependent autophosphorylation of full-length phot1 expressed in insect cells and transgenic Arabidopsis. Moreover, photochemically active LOV2 alone in full-length phot1 is sufficient to elicit hypocotyl phototropism in transgenic Arabidopsis, whereas photochemically active LOV1 alone is not. Further photochemical and biochemical analyses also indicate that the LOV1 and LOV2 domains of phot2 exhibit distinct roles. The significance for the different roles of the phototropin LOV domains is discussed.},

Although it arose originally from neuroscience, optogenetics is widely applicable to the study of many different biological systems and the range of applications arising from this technology continues to increase. Moreover, the repertoire of light-sensitive proteins used for devising new optogenetic tools is rapidly expanding. Light, Oxygen, or Voltage sensing (LOV) and Blue-Light-Utilizing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (BLUF) domains represent new contributors to the optogenetic toolkit. These small (100\textendash 140-amino acids) flavoprotein modules are derived from plant and bacterial photoreceptors that respond to UV-A/blue light. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in uncovering the photoactivation mechanisms of both LOV and BLUF domains. This knowledge has been applied in the design of synthetic photoswitches and fluorescent reporters with applications in cell biology and biotechnology. In this review, we summarize the photochemical properties of LOV and BLUF photosensors and highlight some of the recent advances in how these flavoproteins are being employed to artificially regulate and image a variety of biological processes.},

Light is a nearly ubiquitous environmental factor, and many species have evolved the capability to respond to this extracellular stimulus. Numerous photoreceptors underlie the activation of light-sensitive signal transduction cascades controlling these responses. Here, we review the properties of the light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) family of blue-light photoreceptor domains, a subset of the Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) superfamily. These flavin-binding domains, first identified in the higher-plant phototropins, are now shown to be present in plants, fungi, and bacteria. Notably, LOV domains are coupled to a wide array of other domains, including kinases, phosphodiesterases, F-box domains, STAS domains, and zinc fingers, which suggests that the absorption of blue light by LOV domains regulates the activity of these structurally and functionally diverse domains. LOV domains contain a conserved molecular volume extending from the flavin cofactor, which is the locus for light-driven structural change, to the molecular surface. We discuss the role of this conserved volume of structure in LOV-regulated processes.},

It is responsible for efficient energy dissipation in reaction sites, and has been linked to pathways of allosteric communication. While it is understood that VET occurs via backbone as well as via non-covalent contacts, little is known about the competition of these two transport channels, which determines the VET pathways. To tackle this problem, we equipped the {$\beta$}-hairpin fold of a tryptophan zipper with pairs of non-canonical amino acids, one serving as a VET injector and one as a VET sensor in a femtosecond pump probe experiment. Accompanying extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations combined with a master equation analysis unravel the VET pathways. Our joint experimental/computational endeavor reveals the efficiency of backbone vs. contact transport, showing that even if cutting short backbone stretches of only 3 to 4 amino acids in a protein, hydrogen bonds are the dominant VET pathway.},

Here, we report the full-length crystal structure of the engineered, dimeric, blue-light-regulated SHK YF1 at 2.3 A\r{} resolution, in which two N-terminal light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) photosensors are connected by a coiled coil to the C-terminal effector modules. A second coaxial coiled coil derived from the N-termini of the LOV photosensors and inserted between them crucially modulates light regulation: single mutations within this coiled coil attenuate or even invert the signal response of the TCS. Structural motifs identified in YF1 recur in signal receptors, and the underlying signaling principles and mechanisms may be widely shared between soluble and transmembrane, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic signal receptors of diverse biological activity.},

  abstract = {The marine environment has unique properties of light transmission, with an attenuation of long wavelengths within the first meters of the water column. Marine organisms have therefore evolved specific blue-light receptors such as aureochromes to absorb shorter-wavelength light. Here, we identify and characterize a light, oxygen, or voltage sensing (LOV) containing histidine kinase (LOV-HK) that functions as a new class of eukaryotic blue-light receptor in the pico-phytoplanktonic cell Ostreococcus tauri. This LOV-HK is related to the large family of LOV-HKs found in prokaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the LOV domains from LOV-HKs, including O. tauri LOV-HK, and phototropins (phot; plant and green algal LOV serine/threonine kinases) have different evolutionary histories. Photochemical analysis shows that the LOV domain of LOV-HK binds a flavin cofactor and absorbs blue light with a fast photocycle compared with its prokaryotic counterparts. Ostreococcus tauri LOV-HK expression is induced by blue light and is under circadian control. Further, both overexpression and downregulation of LOV-HK result in arrhythmia of the circadian reporter CCA1:Luc under constant blue light. In contrast, photochemical inactivation of O. tauri LOV-HK is without effect, demonstrating its importance for function of the circadian clock under blue light. Overexpression/ downregulation of O. tauri LOV-HK alters CCA1 rhythmicity under constant red light, irrespective of LOV-HK's photochemical reactivity, suggesting that O. tauri LOV-HK also participates in regulation of the circadian clock independent of its blue-light-sensing property. Molecular characterization of O. tauri LOV-HK demonstrates that this type of photoreceptor family is not limited to prokaryotes.},

They absorb light through a flavin cofactor, photochemically form a covalent bond between the chromophore and a cysteine residue in the protein, and proceed to mediate activation of an attached kinase domain. Although the photoreaction itself is now well-characterized experimentally and computationally, it is still unclear how the formation of the adduct leads to kinase activation. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations on the LOV1 domain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the LOV2 domain of Avena sativa, both before and after the photoreaction, to answer this question. The extensive simulations, over 240 ns in duration, reveal significant differences in how the LOV1 and LOV2 domains respond to photoactivation. The simulations indicate that LOV1 activation is likely caused by a change in hydrogen bonding between protein and ligand that destabilizes a highly conserved salt bridge, whereas LOV2 activation seems to result from a change in the flexibility of a set of protein loops. Results of electrostatics calculations, principal component analysis, sequence alignments, and root mean-square deviation analysis corroborate the above findings.},

These proteins contain flavin-binding LOV (Light-Oxygen-Voltage) domains that form covalent cysteine-flavin adducts upon exposure to blue light, leading to the enhancement of phototropin kinase activity. Several lines of evidence suggest that adduct formation in the phototropin LOV2 domains leads to the dissociation of an alpha helix (J{$\alpha$}) from these domains as part of the light-induced activation process. However, crystal structures of LOV domains both in the presence and absence of the J{$\alpha$} helix show very few differences between dark and illuminated states, and thus the precise mechanism through which adduct formation triggers helical dissociation remains poorly understood. Using Avena sativa phototropin 1 LOV2 as a model system, we have studied the interactions of the LOV domain core with the J{$\alpha$} helix through a series of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Here we show that conformational transitions of a conserved glutamine residue in the flavin binding pocket are coupled to altered dynamics of the J{$\alpha$} helix both through a shift in dynamics of the main {$\beta$}-sheet of the LOV domain core and through a secondary pathway involving the N-terminal A{${'}\alpha$} helix.},

  abstract = {Light\textendash oxygen\textendash voltage sensitive (LOV) flavoproteins are ubiquitous photoreceptors that mediate responses to environmental cues. Photosensory inputs are transduced into signaling outputs via structural rearrangements in sensor domains that consequently modulate the activity of an effector domain or multidomain clusters. Establishing the diversity in effector function and sensor\textendash effector topology will inform what signaling mechanisms govern light-responsive behaviors across multiple kingdoms of life and how these signals are transduced. Here, we report the bioinformatics identification of over 6,700 candidate LOV domains (including over 4,000 previously unidentified sequences from plants and protists), and insights from their annotations for ontological function and structural arrangements. Motif analysis identified the sensors from {$\sim$}42 million ORFs, with strong statistical separation from other flavoproteins and non-LOV members of the structurally related Per-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-Sim family. Conserved-domain analysis determined putative light-regulated function and multidomain topologies. We found that for certain effectors, sensor\textendash effector linker length is discretized based on both phylogeny and the preservation of {$\alpha$}-helical heptad repeats within an extended coiled-coil linker structure. This finding suggests that preserving sensor\textendash effector orientation is a key determinant of linker length, in addition to ancestry, in LOV signaling structure\textendash function. We found a surprisingly high prevalence of effectors with functions previously thought to be rare among LOV proteins, such as regulators of G protein signaling, and discovered several previously unidentified effectors, such as lipases. This work highlights the value of applying genomic and transcriptomic technologies to diverse organisms to capture the structural and functional variation in photosensory proteins that are vastly important in adaptation, photobiology, and optogenetics.},

  abstract = {Light oxygen voltage-sensing (LOV) domains are widely found in photoreceptor proteins of plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria. Structural studies of LOV domains suggest that Phe and Gln residues located in the proximity of the chromophore undergo conformational changes upon illumination; however, the molecular mechanism associated with activation of the effector domain remains to be elucidated. Photozipper (PZ) protein is an N-terminally truncated aureochrome-1 comprising a LOV domain and a basic leucine zipper domain. Blue light (BL) induces PZ dimerization and subsequently increases its affinity for target DNA. In this study, we prepared PZ mutants with substitutions of F298 and Q317 and performed quantitative analyses in dark and light states. Substitutions of Q317 significantly reduced the light-induced changes in PZ affinity for the target DNA, especially in the case of the high affinities observed in the dark state. Upon illumination, all PZ mutants showed increased affinity for the target sequence, which demonstrated a clear correlation with the dimer fraction of each PZ mutant. These results suggest the existence of a conformational equilibrium and that its shift by a synergistic interaction between the chromophore and protein moiety probably enables BLregulated switching of aureochrome-1.},

To this end, the vertical absorption spectra of eight lumiflavin-related compounds were calculated by means of quantum chemical methods. The compounds differ from lumiflavin by the subsitution of an S atom for an O atom at the 2- and/or 4-positions of the isoalloxazine core, the substitution of an N atom for a CH group in the 6- and/or 9-positions, or an extension of the {$\pi$} system at the 7- and 8-positions. For the three most promising compounds, 2-thio-lumiflavin, 4-thio-lumiflavin, and 2,4-dithio-lumiflavin, the quantum chemical investigations were extended to include geometry relaxations in the excited states, rates for spin-forbidden transitions and an estimate of spectral shifts brought about by polar protic environments. We find these thiocarbonyl compounds to have very promising excited-state properties. They absorb in the blue-green wavelength regime around 500 nm, i.e., substantially red-shifted with respect to lumiflavin that is the cofactor of natural blue-light photoreceptors. Their triplet quantum yields are predicted to be close to unity while their triplet lifetimes are long enough to enable bimolecular photochemical reactions. The combination of these properties makes the thioflavins potentially suitable candidates as cofactors in biomimetic photoswitches.},

Its topology, in which a C-terminal LOV sensor domain is linked to an N-terminal DNA-binding bZIP effector domain, contrasts with the reverse sensor-effector topology in most other known LOV-photoreceptors. How, then, is signal transmitted in Aureochrome1? The dark- and light-state crystal structures of Aureochrome1 LOV domain (AuLOV) show that its helical N- and C-terminal flanking regions are packed against the external surface of the core b sheet, opposite to the FMN chromophore on the internal surface. Light-induced conformational changes occur in the quaternary structure of the AuLOV dimer and in Phe298 of the Hb strand in the core. The properties of AuLOV extend the applicability of LOV domains as versatile design modules that permit fusion to effector domains via either the N- or Ctermini to confer blue-light sensitivity.},

Here, we report the unexpectedly important role of the single methionine residue, Met-353, where busy trafficking of electron-tunneling currents is observed. The amino acid conservation pattern of Met-353 in the homologous sequences perfectly correlates with experimentally verified annotation as photolyases. The bioinformatics sequence analysis also suggests that the residue plays a pivotal role in biological function. Consistent findings from different disciplines of computational biology strongly suggest the pivotal role of Met-353 in the biological function of DNA photolyase.},

Illumination of the resultant fusion kinase YF1 reduced net kinase activity by {$\sim$}1000-fold in vitro. YF1 also controls gene expression in a light-dependent manner in vivo. Signals are transmitted from the light-oxygen-voltage sensor domain to the histidine kinase domain via a 40\textdegree\textendash 60\textdegree{} rotational movement within an {$\alpha$}-helical coiled-coil linker; light is acting as a rotary switch.

  abstract = {Two-component systems (TCS) constitute the predominant means by which prokaryotes read out and adapt to their environment. Canonical TCSs comprise a sensor histidine kinase (SHK), usually a transmembrane receptor, and a response regulator (RR). In signal-dependent manner, the SHK autophosphorylates and in turn transfers the phosphoryl group to the RR which then elicits downstream responses, often in form of altered gene expression. SHKs also catalyze the hydrolysis of the phospho-RR, hence, tightly adjusting the overall degree of RR phosphorylation. Photoreceptor histidine kinases are a subset of mostly soluble, cytosolic SHKs that sense light in the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral range. Owing to their experimental tractability, photoreceptor histidine kinases serve as paradigms and provide unusually detailed molecular insight into signal detection, decoding, and regulation of SHK activity. The synthesis of recent results on receptors with light-oxygen-voltage, bacteriophytochrome and microbial rhodopsin sensor units identifies recurring, joint signaling strategies. Light signals are initially absorbed by the sensor module and converted into subtle rearrangements of {$\alpha$} helices, mostly through pivoting and rotation. These conformational transitions propagate through parallel coiled-coil linkers to the effector unit as changes in left-handed superhelical winding. Within the effector, subtle conformations are triggered that modulate the solvent accessibility of residues engaged in the kinase and phosphatase activities. Taken together, a consistent view of the entire trajectory from signal detection to regulation of output emerges. The underlying allosteric mechanisms could widely apply to TCS signaling in general.},

  abstract = {The primary photochemical reaction of the light, oxygen, and voltage (LOV) domain of the blue-light photosensor YtvA of Bacillus subtilis were investigated using high-level QM(DFT/MRCI)/MM methods. After blue-light excitation, the S{$\gamma$} atom of the reactive cysteine forms a covalent bond with the C4a of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) ring. Two conformations for the side chain of reactive cysteine with occupancies of 70\% (conf A) and 30\% (conf B) are observed in the X-ray crystallographic structures of the YtvA-LOV (M\"oglich, A.; Moffat, K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007, 373, 112-126). In conf A, the thiol group is directed toward the dimethylbenzene moiety of the FMN ring whereas it is placed directly above the N5 atom of the FMN ring in conf B. Starting from both conformations, the singlet and triplet excited pathways were evaluated. The singlet states excited from conf A decay nonradiatively to the triplet states by intersystem crossing (ISC). After the formation of a neutral biradical, the triplet states cross over to the electronic ground state by a second ISC and the adducts are efficiently formed. The singlet states excited from conf B are located near the S1/S0 conical intersection (CIn). A major fraction returns to the initial states through the CIn. The rest may directly reach the adduct state. Thus, the photoexcitation has a dual reaction pathway. In YtvA-LOV, it is inferred that the efficient triplet excitation from conf A was chosen by bypassing the less efficient singlet excitation from conf B.},

  abstract = {Light is a key stimulus for plant biological functions, several of which are controlled by lightactivated kinases known as phototropins, a group of kinases that contain two light-sensing domains (LOV, light-oxygen-voltage domains) and a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. The second sensory domain, LOV2, plays a key role in regulating kinase enzymatic activity via the photochemical formation of a covalent adduct between a LOV2 cysteine residue and an internally bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore. Subsequent conformational changes in LOV2 lead to the unfolding of a peripheral JR helix and, ultimately, phototropin kinase activation. To date, the mechanism coupling bond formation and helix dissociation has remained unclear. Previous studies found that a conserved glutamine residue [Q513 in the AVena satiVa phototropin 1 LOV2 (AsLOV2) domain] switches its hydrogen bonding pattern with FMN upon light stimulation. Located in the immediate vicinity of the FMN binding site, this Gln residue is provided by the I{$\beta$} strand that interacts with the JR helix, suggesting a route for signal propagation from the core of the LOV domain to its peripheral JR helix. To test whether Q513 plays a key role in tuning the photochemical and transduction properties of AsLOV2, we designed two point mutations, Q513L and Q513N, and monitored the effects on the chromophore and protein using a combination of UV-visible absorbance and circular dichroism spectroscopy, limited proteolysis, and solution NMR. The results show that these mutations significantly dampen the changes between the dark and lit state AsLOV2 structures, leaving the protein in a pseudodark state (Q513L) or a pseudolit state (Q513N). Further, both mutations changed the photochemical properties of this receptor, in particular the lifetime of the photoexcited signaling states. Together, these data establish that this residue plays a central role in both spectral tuning and signal propagation from the core of the LOV domain through the I{$\beta$} strand to the peripheral JR helix.},

On the basis of the reorganized network that we obtain for {$\beta$}2AR upon activation, we identify a branched pathway between the agonist binding site and the cytoplasmic region, where a G-protein binds to the receptor when activated. The pathway includes all of the motifs containing molecular switches previously identified as contributing to the allosteric transition of {$\beta$}2AR upon agonist binding. EENs and their reorganization upon activation are compared with structure-based contact networks computed for the inactive and active states of {$\beta$}2AR.},

  abstract = {Phototropins, a class of light-activated protein kinases, are essential for several blue light responses in plants and algae, including phototropism. These proteins contain two internal light, oxygen, and voltage sensitive (LOV) domains, which bind flavin chromophores and undergo a reversible photochemical formation of a cysteinyl-flavin adduct as part of the light sensing process. While the photodynamic properties of such photosensory domains are dictated by interactions between the chromophore and surrounding protein, more distant residues can play a significant role as well. Here we explore the role of the Phe434 residue in the photosensory response of the second LOV domain of Avena sativa phototropin 1 (AsLOV2), a model photochemical system for these LOV domains. Phe434 is more than 6 \AA{} from the FMN chromophore in AsLOV2; nevertheless, an F434Y point mutation is likely to change several structural features of the chromophore binding site, as we demonstrate using molecular dynamics simulations. Transient absorption signals spanning 15 decades in time were compared for wild-type AsLOV2 and the F434Y mutant, showing that the latter has significantly altered photodynamics, including (i) a faster intersystem crossing leading to triplet formation on a nanosecond time scale, (ii) biphasic formation of adduct-state kinetics on the microsecond time scale, and (iii) greatly accelerated ground-state recovery kinetics on a second time scale. We present mechanistic models that link these spectroscopic differences to changes in the configuration of the critical cysteine residue and in the chromophore's accessibility to solvent and oxygen according to MD trajectories and purging experiments. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of residues outside the chromophore-binding pocket in modulating LOV domain photodynamics.},

They function as input modules in proteins that sense oxygen, redox potential, light, and some other stimuli. Specificity in sensing arises, in part, from different cofactors that may be associated with the PAS fold. Transduction of redox signals may be a common mechanistic theme in many different PAS domains. PAS proteins are always located intracellularly but may monitor the external as well as the internal environment. One way in which prokaryotic PAS proteins sense the environment is by detecting changes in the electron transport system. This serves as an early warning system for any reduction in cellular energy levels. Human PAS proteins include hypoxia-inducible factors and voltage-sensitive ion channels; other PAS proteins are integral components of circadian clocks. Although PAS domains were only recently identified, the signaling functions with which they are associated have long been recognized as fundamental properties of living cells.},

The crystal structure of the fully light-adapted VVD dimer reveals the mechanism by which light driven conformational change alters oligomeric state. Photo-induced formation of a cysteinyl-flavin adduct generates a new hydrogen bond network that releases the N-terminus from the protein core and restructures an acceptor pocket for its binding on the opposite subunit. Substitution of residues key to the monomer/dimer switch have profound effects on light adaptation in Neurospora. The VVD dimerization mechanism provides the molecular details for how a large family of photoreceptors converts light responses to alterations in protein interactions.},

In this paper, several aspects of the photophysics and photochemistry of lumiflavin in a (protein) environment will be studied with the help of quantum chemical methods. In a first part of the paper, we present vertical singlet excitation energies for lumiflavin (a molecule of the isoalloxazin type), using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) in conjunction with the B3LYP hybrid functional. When calculated for isolated species, TD-DFT excitation energies are generally blue-shifted relative to the experimental absorption spectra of isoalloxazines in solution, or in a protein environment. We develop four different models to account for environmental effects, with special emphasis on the LOV1 domain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It is found that the two lowest, allowed singlet excitations are sensitive to the polarizability of an environment, to hydrogen bonds, and to geometrical constraints imposed by the surrounding protein. All of this brings theory and experiment in better agreement.},

  abstract = {The fungal photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) plays an important role in the adaptation of blue-light responses in Neurospora crassa. VVD, an FAD-binding LOV (light, oxygen, voltage) protein, couples light-induced cysteinyl adduct formation at the flavin ring to conformational changes in the N-terminal cap (Ncap) of the VVD PAS domain. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and static and dynamic light scattering show that these conformational changes generate a rapidly exchanging VVD dimer, with an expanded hydrodynamic radius. A three-residue N-terminal {$\beta$}-turn that assumes two different conformations in a crystal structure of a VVD C71V variant is essential for lightstate dimerization. Residue substitutions at a critical hinge between the Ncap and PAS core can inhibit or enhance dimerization, whereas a Tyr to Trp substitution at the Ncap-PAS interface stabilizes the lightstate dimer. Cross-linking through engineered disulfides indicates that the light-state dimer differs considerably from the dark-state dimer found in VVD crystal structures. These results verify the role of Ncap conformational changes in gating the photic response of N. crassa and indicate that LOV-LOV homo- or heterodimerization may be a mechanism for regulating light-activated gene expression.},
